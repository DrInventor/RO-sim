# RO-sim  (Research Objects Similarity) #
======
This repository contains the approach to measure the similarity between ROs. This work is part of [EU FP7 Project DrInventor](http://drinventor.eu/)

The similarity metrics are based on the ontology matching techniques.

This repository contains:
* Similarity metrics for assesment the similarity between two ROs.
* A Java client to interact with NASA's ADS

##Status##

The initial version of the similarity metrics based on ontology matching techniques is under development.

## Configuration

## Dependencies

## Database configuration

## How to run tests

### A Java client to interact with NASA's ADS ###
This project also includes a module to interact with NASA's ADS [http://labs.adsabs.harvard.edu/adsabs/](http://labs.adsabs.harvard.edu/adsabs/)

**Getting Started**

1. You'll need an API key from NASA ADS labs.

1. When you get your API key, save it to a file called ~/.ads/dev_key
